# Homemade-Neural-Network
The primary objective of this particular project is to undertake a comprehensive assessment of a real estate dataset, in order to determine whether the properties were successfully sold within the specified time frame of 30 days. To achieve this, a custom neural network was designed and implemented, utilizing a range of techniques to train and optimize the model. The project began by conducting an exploratory data analysis, in order to identify the relevant variables for the neural network. Subsequently, the data was cleaned, normalized, and trained to make predictions.

It should be noted, however, that the homemade neural network utilized in this project is not without its limitations. Despite this, the focus of the project was to delve deep into the intricate workings of neural networks, thereby gaining insights into the underlying algorithms and principles.
